    "## Introduction to Dask\n",
    "\n",
    "[Dask](https://dask.org/) is a library for scalable computing in Python. It primarily does two things: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scheduling tasks on a cluster. This helps parallelize intensive computational tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Contains implementations of collections for large datasets. This helps manage large datasets, so that scheduling tasks on them becomes more easy to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with scheduling and how that works. We'll start with a trivial computational task. The following cell implements two simple computational operations. An `inc` function that increments a number by 1, and an `add` function that adds together two numbers. To demonstrate the effects of parallelization, we will also have each one of these functions sleep for a little while, to simulate more intensive time-demanding computations. "

    "\n",
    "First of all, what is a decorator? One way to think about it (but it's not the [full](https://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/decorating_for_dummies.html) [story](https://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/decorating_for_smart_people.html)) is that it's a function that takes a function as input and produces a function as output. \n",
